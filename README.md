4. **Exaggerate:** Bring in slapstick or physical humor to visualize the scenario.
5. **Reverse:** Add a surprising reversal to keep the audience on their toes.
6. **Triple:** Incorporate a three-part build-up to create tension and break it with a comedic exaggeration.
7. **Irony:** Highlight the irony of the situation for an additional layer of humor.
8. **Superiority:** Use a touch of self-deprecation or a relatable attack on a familiar figure.
9. **Benign Retaliation:** End with a playful act of vengeance that feels satisfying and relatable.
